# 🌤️ Casablanca Weather Prediction using Markov Chains

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a **Markov Chain model** to analyze historical weather patterns in Casablanca and predict future weather conditions. Using meteorological data from 2022, we build transition probability matrices to forecast weather states for 2023.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze 2022 weather data using Discrete-Time Markov Chains
- Build transition probability matrices for weather state transitions
- Predict 2023 weather patterns based on historical probabilities
- Evaluate prediction accuracy against actual 2023 data

## 🧮 Theoretical Foundation

### Markov Chain Principles
We model weather as a **Discrete-Time Markov Process** where:
- **States** represent discretized weather conditions
- **Transitions** capture probabilities between consecutive states
- **Memoryless Property** ensures next state depends only on current state

### Mathematical Approach
For each weather variable, we compute:
- **Transition Probability Matrix** showing likelihood of moving between states
- **State Vectors** representing current weather conditions
- **Predictions** generated by applying transition probabilities

## 📊 Data Processing

### Input Data Structure
The analysis uses daily weather recordings including:
- Temperature measurements (average, min, max)
- Precipitation levels
- Wind characteristics (speed, direction, gusts)
- Atmospheric pressure

### State Discretization
Weather variables are categorized into discrete states:

| Variable | Categories | Thresholds |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Temperature | Cold, Moderate, Hot | Below 15°C, 15-25°C, Above 25°C |
| Precipitation | Dry, Light Rain, Heavy Rain | 0mm, Under 5mm, 5mm or more |
| Wind Speed | Low, Moderate, Strong | Under 10km/h, 10-20km/h, Over 20km/h |
| Atmospheric Pressure | Low, Normal, High | Below 1005hPa, 1005-1020hPa, Above 1020hPa |

## 🔄 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Remove incomplete columns with excessive missing values
- Apply interpolation to handle remaining gaps in data
- Ensure dataset consistency for reliable analysis

### 2. Transition Matrix Construction
- Analyze sequences of daily weather states

- Calculate probabilities for each possible transition
- Create comprehensive transition matrices for all variables

### 3. Prediction Generation
- Start from initial weather state

- Generate daily weather predictions for entire year
- Support both probabilistic and deterministic forecasting
